I'm a person who loves making plans. On the other hand, I'm a person who's absolutely awful at following through with them.
One major issue I've always had is that I much more naturally prefer the immediate satisfaction of smaller habits or media to the one big dopamine hit of
  completing a huge project.
My brother is in a rigorous academic environment, and I've noticed that, although he enjoys addictive TV and video games, he's realized he can't possibly juggle
  a flourishing academic life and the addictive nature of certain types of media. The video game will win out every time.
From my brother's example, I figured that I should try out adopting a similar system. I may not have a rigorous academic environment to push me along, but
  if I work on one main project at a time, I should be able to make steady progress towards goals rather than only managing scattershot small to-dos,
  which is what happens when I have too many goals.
