1. I like to take notes on media I've completed, but I can end up wasting a lot of time doing extra research on TV Tropes or other websites.
Everything came to a head when I wasted an entire morning studying up on factoids about Ratchet and Clank after I beat the game even earlier in the morning.
The wast of time ruined my motivation for the rest of the day.
CHANGE: I decided to separate my media into the game itself, and then adding a todo on my list to look up the exra research.
