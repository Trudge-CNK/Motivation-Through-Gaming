# motivation-through-gaming
Once I was out of the treadmill of schooling, I didn't have any solid way to track my progress. Years went by without really seeing solid growth.  
In comparison to the real world, video game are made specifically to drag the player along with a perfect difficulty curve, resulting in the player
savings the world, etc. Because of that perfect curve, I've been stuck in fantasy lands for a long while, but now I plan to bridge the gap.  
For every step I make towards my real life goals, I'll be allowing myself a snippet of gameplay. Even if I can't see the delineated progress of my
real life goals, I'll be able to see where I've been able to progress in the video game.
