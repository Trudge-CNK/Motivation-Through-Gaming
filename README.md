# personal-goals
I plan to track and update my progress on all sorts of personal goals, habits, projects, and hobbies for sharing, accountability, and just to straight up see my progress over time.

I'm tracking and making opinions on any hobby that I work on 90 days in a row.
I'm tracking all of my current projects, both short and long term.
I'm tracking my progress in learning new things through my Lifelong University system.
I'm tracking all my notes and opinions on the media I consume.
